                                    localStorage and sessionStorage are almost identical and have the same API. The
                                    difference is that with sessionStorage, the data is persisted only until the window
                                    or tab is closed. With localStorage, the data is persisted until the user manually
                                    clears the browser cache or until our web app clears the data.

                                    The <strong>event loop</strong> is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous
                                    programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart
                                    data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading. <br><br>
                                    The <strong>call stack</strong> is responsible for keeping track of all the
                                    operations in line to be
                                    executed. Whenever a function is finished, it is popped from the stack. <br><br>
                                    The <strong>event queue</strong> is responsible for sending new functions to the
                                    stack for processing. It follows the queue data structure to maintain the correct
                                    sequence in which all operations should be sent for execution. <br><br>
                                    Whenever an async function is called, it is sent to a browser API. These are APIs
                                    built into the browser. Based on the command received from the call stack, the API
                                    starts its own single-threaded operation. <br><br>

                                    An example of this is the <strong>setTimeout</strong> method. When a
                                    <strong>setTimeout</strong>
                                    operation is
                                    processed in the stack, it is sent to the corresponding API which waits till the
                                    specified time to send this operation back in for processing.

                                    Where does it send the operation? The <strong>event queue</strong>. Hence, we have a
                                    cyclic system
                                    for running async operations in JavaScript. The language itself is single-threaded,
                                    but the browser APIs act as separate threads. <br><br>

                                    The <strong>event loop</strong> facilitates this process; it constantly checks
                                    whether or not the
                                    <strong>call stack</strong> is empty. If it is empty, new functions are added from
                                    the <strong>event
                                          queue</strong>.
                                    If it is not, then the current function call is processed.
